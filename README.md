# VisTumor
VisTumor is a deep learning project focused on detecting cancer in histopathology images with an emphasis on explainability. Using CNNs trained on high-resolution microscope images, this project applies Grad-CAM++ and saliency mapping to visually highlight learned features that influence model predictions.
